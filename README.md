---

## Overview
The Poem Classification project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to categorize poems. This model is capable of understanding different poetry styles, such as Haiku, Sonnet, Free Verse, and more. It is designed to help literature enthusiasts, educators, and researchers analyze poetry more effectively.

Key Features:

- Preprocessing of Poem Text Data

- Classification using Advanced ML and NLP Models

- Interactive Web Application for Real-time Predictions

- Deployment on Render for Public Access
---

## Motivation

Poetry is a unique form of text that expresses emotions, and classifying it into different genres helps in literary analysis,
recommendation systems, and educational tools. This project showcases the power of deep learning in text classification.
---

## Technical Aspect
### Training Recommendation Model:

Data Collection:

- A dataset of poems is sourced from public repositories and literature archives.

Preprocessing:

- Text cleaning (removal of special characters, punctuation, and stopwords).

- Tokenization and lemmatization.

- Vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).

Model Training:

- Classifiers Used: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and BERT.

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

Model Evaluation:

- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Web App Development:

- Built using Flask.

- User input for poem text classification.

- Deployed on Render.
---

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. Install the required packages and libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
To run the Flask web app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Deployment on Render

To deploy the Flask web app on Render:
- Push your code to GitHub.
- Log in to Render and create a new web service.
- Connect the GitHub repository.
- Configure environment variables (if any).
- Deploy and access your app live.
